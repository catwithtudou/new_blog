## 1. Care About Your Craft.
   
Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?
Why do you write software? Is it just a job, a means to an end, or is it something more? Do you take pride in your work, or do you just churn out code that barely works?



## 2. Think! About Your Work.

Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and appraise your work.
Do you ever find yourself writing code without thinking? Do you ever copy and paste solutions from the internet without understanding them? Do you ever follow instructions blindly without questioning them?



## 3. You Have Agency.
   
It’s your life. Grab a hold of it and make it what you want.



## 4. Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses.
   
Instead of excuses, provide options. Don’t say it can’t be done; explain what can be done.



## 5. Don’t Live with Broken Windows.
   
Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them.



## 6. Be a Catalyst for Change.
   
You can’t force change on people. Instead, show them how the future might be and help them participate in creating it.



## 7. Remember the Big Picture 
   
Don’t get so engrossed in the details that you forget to check what’s happening around you.



### 8. Make Quality a Requirements Issue.**
   
Involve your users in determining the project’s real quality requirements.



## 9. Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio.
   
Learning is essential for programmers. Don’t stop at what you know. Explore new topics, skills, and technologies. Invest in your knowledge portfolio regularly. Make learning a habit.



## 10. Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear.
    
Don’t be swayed by vendors, media hype, or dogma. Analyze information in terms of you and your project.
