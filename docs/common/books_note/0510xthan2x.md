# 24.07《10x easier than 2x》阅读

> 0802:目前与阅读之前最大的感想就是： 
> 
> 想不到竟然能够将10x思维总结为一套思维框架，其中我印象比较深的关键点：
>  
> - 10倍的目标实际上就是类似具有极大优势的高杠杆的策略目标 
> - 放弃现有的 80%，全力以赴追求想要的 20%时，能够带来更多高质量的自由 
> - 与2倍思维相比它是非线性的，带来反直觉的观点，即巨大的增长往往需要更少但更好的努力 
> - 需要减少数量，重点放在持续不断地提高所有事情的质量 
> - 提高自己最低标准的阈值，是实现 10 倍转变的基础 
> - （反直觉观点）10倍目标可能比2倍目标更容易实现 
> - “想要”的生活方式即选择自由并想要创造，这样才能拥有它，以此带来10倍回报 
>
> 里面的挺多观点我觉得都和刻意练习的底层逻辑是一样，但我觉得它与众不同的点： 是以一个10倍的概念来总结提炼出了这一套思维框架，把抽象的概念变得更加具体，这样才是能够作为基础或者原则，更加方便落地和实践，而做到这一点是非常困难的，这是我非常敬佩作者的地方，也帮助我拓展了另一种认知视野。 
>
> 虽然在日常生活中，这一点对我来说实践起来还是比较困难（以至于我在后面阅读中作者提到这种思维往往是适合“管理者”的时候，导致我的阅读兴趣大减少），但是潜移默化地也带来了一些微妙的变化，在我每天工作和生活中，比如：开始渐渐去做事情上的“减法”，对我来说即聚焦于重要且困难的事情，而其他的琐事则放在某一个时间段集中或者定时去处理；开始尝试给自己定更高的标准，比如同样的事情我要得到与以前相比更多的产出，让自己逐渐习惯这样的标准，然后不断去提高这一个阈值，就像目前工作上的职级要求。

> 考虑后面部分对我来说作用不大，这本书大概就看到这里嘞。

## Part 1: 10x Principles

## Chapter1: THE SURPRISING SIMPLICITY OF 10x GROWTH

### Why the 2x Mindset Is the Enemy of Results

“The road to hell is paved with the pursuit of volume. Volume leads to marginal products, marginal customers, and greatly increased managerial complexity . . . Hard work leads to low returns. Insight and doing what we want leads to high returns . . . Strive for excellence in few things, rather than good performance in many . . .It is not shortage of time that should worry us, but the tendency for the majority of time to be spent in low-quality ways . . . The 80/20principle says that if we doubled our time on the top 20 percent of activities, we could work a two-day week and achieve 60 percent more than now.”

— RICHARD KOCH

### The 10x vs. 2x Framework:Why 10x and 2x Are Literally Opposites

“If we didn’t have ambition—some big goal we are after—how would we know what little things, what distractions, to say no to?”

— RYAN HOLIDAY

### How to Make Continuous 10x Jumps and Create Exponential Freedom

“A 2x goal would involve doing the same things you’re doing now,only more of them. But a 10x goal jumps you out of that, beyond that. 10x requires operating in an entirely different way that bypasses the stresses and complications of a 2x goal.”

— DAN SULLIVAN

> what about you?

What is your 20 percent that if you went all-in on, you’d become 10x more valuable and impactful?

What are the few things you do and the few people you work with that produce most of your success and excitement?

What is your 80 percent that is keeping you grinding away, and ultimately a distraction for your biggest future jumps?


### chapter takeaways

看似不可能的目标比可能的目标更实际，因为不可能的目标迫使你超越你现在的知识和假设。

很少有路径能创造 10 倍的效果。通过真正的反思，一个 10 倍的目标会突出少数路径——高杠杆策略和关系——具有极大的优势。

10 倍目标可以让你清楚地识别出生活中 20% 的事情和人，他们产生了你大部分的结果，以及生活中 80% 的事情和人，他们在阻碍你。

追求 2 倍增长意味着你可以保留 80% 的现有客户、角色、行为和心态。只需要进行轻微的调整。

追求 10 倍增长意味着你必须消除 80% 的现有客户、角色、行为和思维模式。10 倍增长需要你以及你周围的一切进行全面转型。

2x 是线性的——要继续增长需要付出更多努力。它更努力，而不是更聪明。它注重数量——你只是在做更多你现在做的事情，而不考虑质量、独特性或转型。

10x是非线性的——巨大的增长不需要更多的努力，但往往需要更少，但更好。它是定性的——你已经提升了你的视野和重点，以至于你现在正在为越来越具体的人改变你所做的事情的价值和影响力。

每当你实现 10 倍增长时，你都是在放手你当前 80% 的业务，深入挖掘更强大、更集中的 20% 业务。放手你当前 80% 的业务，通常需要雇佣 Whos 来接手你当前 80% 业务，并将可重复的业务系统化和组织化，这样你就可以创新那些不可重复的业务。

每当你放弃 80%，全力以赴追求你想要的 20% 时，你的自由（时间、金钱、人际关系和目标）的数量和质量都会大大提高 10 倍。

## Chapter2: 10x THE QUALITY OF EVERYTHING YOU DO

### Shed Your 2x Identity and Relentlessly Raise Your Standards

“How you do anything is how you do everything.”

— ATTRIBUTED TO MARTHA BECK


**Higher quality, less quantity.**


> Dan Sullivan’s The 4C’s Formula

**Commitment Courage Capability Confidence**

> What about you?

What are the standards you hold for yourself?

Were your standards chosen by you, or adopted by the norms of those outside of you?

What are your own minimum standards that you’re focused on and committed to?

What would happen if you dramatically elevated your standards? How can you move toward your 20 percent focus and mastery? What 80 percent would have to go?

### Set Unreachable Goals and 10x the Quality of What You Do

“Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre.The level of competition is thus fiercest for ‘realistic’ goals,paradoxically making them the most time and energy-consuming.It’s easier to raise $1,000,000 than it is $100,000. It’s easier to pick up the one perfect 10 in the bar than the five 8s.”

— TIM FERRISS

> What about you?

Are you living exponentially or linearly?

Are you focused on effort or volume, or are you creating something qualitatively different and better than anything else out there?

Are you spread thin, doing five or more different jobs, or do you have a growing team of people handling your former 80 percent?

### 10x Often and Become the Best at What You Do

“In a world that relentlessly races to the bottom, you lose if you also race to the bottom. The only way to win is to race to the top. . . .The only way to be indispensable is to be different. . . . Expertise gives you enough insight to reinvent what everyone else assumes is the truth. . . . You can train yourself to matter. . . . You are not your résumé. You are your work.”

— SETH  GODIN

**10x is about quality, not quantity.**

**10x is qualitative.**

### Chapter Takeaways

实现 10 倍增长需要持续不断地提高所有事情的质量，减少数量。

你如何做任何事，你就如何做每件事。

抛弃你的双重身份可能很困难，因为作为人类，我们倾向于避免损失，高估我们目前拥有的东西，并希望被视为始终如一。

你的身份是你对自己所相信的故事和你对自己所持的标准。

定义和选择自己的最低标准，无论对你自己和他人来说多么看似不可能，都是实现 10 倍转变的基础。

进化到更高的最低标准需要承诺和勇气，这最终会导致新能力和信心的发展（丹的4C公式）。

吉米·唐纳森的 10 倍过程有三个要素：1）指数级和非线性的思考，2）专注于质量而非数量，3）建立一个团队来处理 80％，这样你就可以专注于提高自己的技能。

10 倍目标比 2 倍目标更容易实现，原因有很多。10 倍目标的竞争力较小。10 倍目标要求你专注于少数事情，而不是很多事情，这会提高你大脑的专注能力——研究表明，持续的任务切换基本上不可能产生流畅感和高绩效。10 倍目标促进非线性方法，产生新颖、创新和无竞争的解决方案。最后，10 倍目标培养领导能力和团队精神，让你不再事必躬亲，不再管理他人，也不再事事追求正确。

创造 10 倍的结果并不要求你比其他人好 10 倍。即使比其他事物好 10% 到20%（并且不同），也可以产生比特定利基市场或领域的异常值更大的 10倍结果。

## Chapter3: 10x EMBRACES ABUNDANCE AND REJECTS SCARCITY

### Get Exactly What You Want, Experience Radical Freedom,and Realize Your Unique Ability

“The world is divided into two types of people: those who are ‘needers’ and those who are ‘wanters.’ Needers compete for scarce resources and opportunities, while wanters are involved in the continual expansion of cooperation among abundance-minded individuals.”

— DAN SULLIVAN

**Wanting and needing are two completely different things.**

### Escape the Scarcity of Needing and Embrace the Abundance of Wanting

A crucial aspect of “wanting what you want” is that you absolutely do not need to justify your desires to anyone.

>  Dan’s two core points about wanting

1. Wanting is about abundance and creation. Creativity is not a scarce resource and takes nothing away from anyone else. Rather, creativity actually creates new resources and opportunities which previously didn’t exist and which would not have existed without someone proactively creating them.
2. Wanting requires no justification. When you want something, you don’t need to justify that want to anyone else. This will be particularly vexing to the self-righteous needers among us who will attempt to manipulate and guilt you into doing what they believe you should be doing,based on their scarcity frame of reference. To go 10x, as well as to live the life you are uniquely suited to live, you can’t pay heed to the scarcity-mongers.

> Money And Wealth

Money is an abstraction, it’s a finite game.

Wealth is reality, it’s an infinite game.There’s no scarcity of wealth.In simple terms: wealth is value.

> Dan teaches 4 Freedoms that are about value

- The value and quality of your time 
- The value and quality of your money
- The value and quality of your relationships
- The value and quality of your overall purpose

**10x is the means, freedom is the end.**

> According to Dan, there are four distinct differences between needers and wanters

1. Needing is extrinsically motivated, whereas wanting is intrinsically motivated.
2. Needing is security-driven, whereas wanting is freedom-driven.
3. Needing is scarcity-minded, whereas wanting is abundance-minded.
4. Needing is reactive, whereas wanting is creative.

**Committing to what you want most is the only way to be free.**

### Clarify and Define Your Unique Ability

“Unique Ability requires you to determine what you personally like and dislike doing, and decide that others’ opinions about it are irrelevant. The basis of Unique Ability is to continually be conscious of the activities andthe settings you like and that energize you—and the things that don’t. This is where freedom starts: with the understanding that your own judgments about your own experience are 100 percent valid… Unique Ability is really amazing. And I have to tell you, it never is a lot of different activities. It’s only a few activities. People say, ‘Well, I have a Unique Ability in 10 different areas. And I say, ‘Well, that might be good for the next 90 days. But you’re going to notice at the end of 90 days that seven of those someone else could do. There’s just 2–3 that are really yours.’ I’ve been on this now for 25–30 years and it’s interesting that you think you’ve gotten to the end of it. But I find, because I’m always doing new things, that what I thought was my Unique Ability before I started taking on a bigger challenge and producing a bigger result,you can fine-tune it even more.”

— DAN SULLIVAN

> You develop your Unique Ability by

Being increasingly honest with yourself and other people about what you most want for yourself and your life. Don’t justify your wants to anyone. No one else is you. No one else wants what you want. No one else has your Unique Ability and your unique vision and desires.

Expanding your vision and thinking exponentially bigger for yourself about what you can be, do, and have. Continually hone your Unique Ability—that which excites you, energizes you, and which you see potential for never-ending improvement—and utilize your Unique Ability to bring forth your 10x vision. Become increasingly clear on who you are and what makes you unique and different from everyone else on this planet.

Clarifying your ideal future self and what they would be doing. Be very specific about this. What context are they in? What mission are they fulfilling? What is the cause they are about? What Unique Ability does your future self have, which they are utilizing to dramatically impact and advance what they most care for? What are the unique standards your future self lives by and has normalized, even though they may seem unfathomable and unrealistic to current you?

Clarifying the 20 percent that if you develop greater mastery in, you’ll experience your desired 10x jump in freedom of time, money, relationships, and overall purpose.

Letting go of the 80 percent and allowing yourself to explore your curiosities and interests.

> It's not Unique Ability

If it doesn’t feel like you’re radically exposing yourself, then it’s not Unique Ability.

If it’s not transforming you rapidly, it’s not Unique Ability.

If it doesn’t feel like play and raw creativity, it’s not Unique Ability.

If the rabbit hole doesn’t go far down, it’s not Unique Ability.

If you’re not innovating, breaking rules, and changing boundaries for what “reality” means in a particular discipline or craft, then it’s not Unique Ability.

> What about you?

What is your Unique Ability?

What is the unique value you provide to others, which no one else can?

What is the 10x jump that excites you most, which requires you go all-in on your Unique Ability to realize?

What’s the 80 percent of your life keeping you busy but unproductive,because it’s keeping you outside your Unique Ability?

### Create Transformational Relationships Where All Parties Are “The Buyer”

“The only man I know who behaves sensibly is my tailor; he takes my measurements anew each time he sees me. The rest go on with their old measurements and expect me to fit them.”

— GEORGE BERNARD SHAW

> a “Buyer” or a “Seller”

Being the Buyer means you have clear standards for yourself, and you know what you want. The opposite is being a Seller, where you’re desperate to be in a particular situation because you think you need it.

As the Seller, you’ll twist yourself into uncomfortable shapes to be accepted. You’re unclear on and uncommitted to your intrinsically crafted standards. You continually lower or change your standards to “get the sale.”

**The difference between a Buyer and a Seller is the Buyer can walk away.**

**To go 10x, you must be the Buyer.**

### Chapter Takeaways

社会训练人们相信自由和创造力是稀缺的资源，需要竞争。这不是真的，因为金钱是有限的资源，而财富是无限的资源。

当你选择自由而不是安全时，你就选择了选择自己想要的生活，而不是争夺你认为自己需要的东西。

以内在需求为基础的生活可以培养一种富足的心态，让你创造自己想要财富和生活，而不需要向任何人解释你为什么想要你想要的。

以外在需求为基础的生活会导致稀缺心态，使你为自己认为需要的有限资源而竞争。以需求为基础生活的人认为他们必须为自己的行为辩护，这样别人才会接受他们。

你必须现在就做出选择：你是愿意继续生活在一个“需要”的世界里，必须为稀缺的资源而竞争，证明自己所做的一切都是合理的，还是愿意拥抱一个“想要”的世界，在那里你可以自由选择、创造，得到你想要的一切？

你只能通过拥抱一种纯粹的想要的生活方式获得 10 倍回报，因为 10 倍回报不是任何人都需要的，只有当你选择自由想要并创造它时，你才能拥有它。

你的独特能力是你是谁的核心和核心方面，只能通过拥抱你最想要的东西来揭示和发展。

你的独特能力是你为他人提供最大价值的方式，即使他们想复制也无法复制。

你的独特能力比任何特定行业或技能都更有价值和令人兴奋，尽管它可以有效地用于教学、领导、战略制定等具体活动。过度将你的独特能力与任何单一活动（如教学）联系起来，将阻碍你提升自己和你独特能力的能力。你的独特能力是推动你最佳和最令人兴奋的表现的动力。

当你拥抱自己的独特能力时，就会进入心流状态，因为你不会根据外界的认可、对结果的依恋等过度编辑自己。相反，你可以随心所欲地做自己想做的事，以自己想的方式去创造。结果，你完全自由，充满活力，由此产生的副产品是灵感迸发的创造力。这也是你如何将你的独特能力提升到超凡脱俗的境界，从而变得独一无二，成为你所从事领域的专家。

要成为你所从事工作的真正大师，你不能仅仅是某方面的专家。专业知识是把事情做好的能力。掌握是把事情独特地做好的能力。大师是永远无法复制的人，只能从他们身上学习。拥抱你的独特能力是你作为一个人如何发展掌握，成为最高和最真实的自己

当你拥抱并认真对待你的独特能力时，你立刻从与任何人的竞争中解脱出来。你认识到，你和其他人都是独一无二的人，永远无法复制。与其试图成为别人，你的目标变成了剥去阻碍你成为最广阔、最发达的“大卫”的层层障碍。

你的独特能力永远不会是成品，随着你的每次10倍跳跃，它会戏剧性地进化。

放弃 80%，完全拥抱最令你兴奋（和最令你恐惧）的 20%，这将使你更接近你的独特能力。

当你将你的独特能力发展到更深层次时，你将有更大的自由来决定你生活中的境遇和机会。与其绝望地处于你并不真正想要的境遇中，你只需要拥抱那些你的独特能力受到重视的境遇和机会，同时，你的独特能力也可以在这些地方得到最大程度的转化和扩展。
